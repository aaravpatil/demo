This configuration file repo serves the purpose of parsing the configuration used for tools under the OWASP AMASS framework.

`oam_i2y` also resides in this repository. It is a tool that converts the legacy INI configuration file into two YAML files that can be used by the framework.

## Users' Guide
For a more detailed guide on using the `configuration file` and `oam_i2y` as an OAM user, please check out:
- [Configuration Users' Guide](./user_guide.md)
